Reaper JS-Plugin "JCooper CS-10² - CC²SX mapper (LED)" [prototype] 2011

no warranty - no copyright - right? this is a kind of simple JS-Hack. 
by time i will dig into the "open controller surface API" (c++) which 
looks really nice, but i haven't found enough docs, so i decided to 
"hack" this little script to get used to the controllers mapping and 
behaviour. ...and JS is quite easy to play with.

preq:
- controller needs in and out... obviously
- enable midi-in/out + control commands for input
- get keymap ...link... ( by ...author... )

LED:
- add script to one track which only receives CC channel 16
- arm the track for recording: "Record: disable (input monitoring only)" 
  (so that no CC, like arming tracks etc. are recorded)
- unarming this track disables any lightshow :)

future:
- using API (c++) for controller surfaces
- switch solo/mute/sel/loc
- cross-nav display
- jog-dial led
- "null"-fader
- sync track status/led
- ...
