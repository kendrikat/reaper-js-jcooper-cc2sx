Reaper JS-Plugin "JCooper CS-10² - CC/SX mapper (LED)"
=========

*[prototype] 2011*

[Reaper] JS-Plugin - Mapping of MIDI-CC to SysEx ([JCooper CS-10² Controller])

**no warranty - this is a simple JS-Hack**

by time i will dig into the "open controller surface API" (c++) which
looks really nice, but i haven't found enough docs, so i decided to
"hack" this little script to get used to the controllers mapping and
behaviour. ...and JS is quite easy to play with.

preq
-
- controller needs in and out... obviously
- enable midi-in/out + control commands for input
- get keymap ...link... ( by ...author... )

LED
-

- add script to one track which only receives CC channel 16
- arm the track for recording: "Record: disable (input monitoring only)"
  (so that no CC, like arming tracks etc. are recorded)
- unarming this track disables any lightshow :)

future
-
- using API (c++) for controller surfaces
- switch solo/mute/sel/loc
- cross-nav display
- jog-dial led
- "null"-fader
- sync track status/led
- ...
